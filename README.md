# Guacamole game 

This is an interpretation of the famous Whack-a-mole game. Players are invited to smash avocadoes that appear
on the screen and earn as many points as they possibly can under 45 seconds (3 rounds, 15 seconds each). 
This game helps to boost player's concentration and response speed. If the end score is high enough (200 or more), the player 
will be rewarded with a nice guacamole recipe. The best score of the player is stored and shown during the game. 
This is a HTML game and it should run on any browser and device. Live page [here](https://irasan.github.io/guacamole/)

## UX
### Project Goals
The primary goal of this project is to create a simple interactive game that will run in any browser. 

### User's Goals
The main audience of this game will be kids and young adults who like to play games or want a short break.
The game promotes quick decision making and concentration so it also can be used by older people.

Player's goals are:
* to play a fun game;
* to see the best score and try to beat it;
* to score at least 200 points in order to win and see the guacamole recipe.

### User Stories
As a first time player, I want:
* to understand the rules or be able to find them;
* to be able to navigate the game easily;
* to be able to turn the music on and off if necessary.

As a return player, I want:
* to see my previous best score;
* to be able to increase the complexity of the game.

### Wireframes
After thorough consideration of users' and developer's goals, the following [wireframes](assets/wireframes) were created. 

### Developer's Goals
This is a learning project and the main purpose of it's creating is to learn JavaScript 
and interactive design implementation. Another very improtant goal is to build a game 
that will be added to the portfolio. 

### Design Choices
The overall feel of the game is fun, simple and relaxed. The following design choices were made 
in order to implement the game:

#### Fonts
Varela Round was chosen as the main font for this website. It is soft, playfull, easy to read, and works great 
at any size.

#### Icons
All icons were chosen for their obvious meaning so that they can be easily understood by everyone. 
Icons were implemented using [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/).

#### Colors and Styling
Simple animation images were chosen for this game. They are not either overwhelming or disctacting. 
Dark green color that reminds of avocadoes is used for icons and buttons. 
Overall design of the game is cheerful, bright, and playful.

## Features
This website features 4 pages: Home, Rules, Game, and Recipe. Home page features a fun image of avocadoes and a button 
with invitation to play. An encouraging message "Smash them all!" appears at the top. Home screen also contains two other 
buttons: one for muting/unmuting music and the other for visiting Rules page.

Rules page contains a short description of how to play the game, an image of yummy guacamole, and two buttons at the bottom: 
one for returning back to Home page, the other for starting the game.

Game page features a yellow game field with a button to start the game. When clicked, the game will start showing a countdown 
timer of 3 seconds for the player to get ready. The same timer will appear before each round. 
The game consists of 3 rounds and the player has to score enough points to move to the next level. If he doesn't succeed, the game will be over.
Each level displays different veggies with increased speed. If a player manages to smash a veg, he'll see a smashing image.
Game page also contains two buttons: one for muting/unmuting music and the other for closing the game.

If the player scores 200 points or more, he'll see a dialog window asking if he/she wants to play again or visit the Recipe page. 
Recipe page displays a congratulation message together with a super secret guacamole recipe. It also features an image of how the 
end product, eg guacamole with tortilla chips, should look like. At the bottom the player will find two buttons: 
one for returning back to Home page, and the other for playing the game.

### Existing Features
* The game is fully functioning and fun to play;
* Call for action buttons - helps users to take control over when to start playing and navigate the site;
* Toggle button for turning music on and off. The state of the toggle button is saved throughout the website;
* Highest score is stored in local storage and displayed during the game.

### Features Left To implement
* There is no pause button when the game is on.
* At the moment the player only sees one kind of veg on each round. Displaying of different veggies with different values, as 
well as some bombs or knives that shouldn't be clicked, were left for future development.

## Technologies used
During completion of this project mainly HTML, CSS and JavaScript were used. To implement some more advanced components, 
like grid of the game, layouts, and modals the developer made use of Bootstrap 4. To create the project, in particular 
write the code itself and store it, GitPod and GitHub were used. Deployment of the website was supported by GitHub pages.

## Testing
### Testing Using Validators
The website was continuously tested on emulated large and small screens when writing the code. 
Upon completion of the writing process, developer used [W3C CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/), 
[W3C MarkUp Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/), and [JSHint validator](https://jshint.com/) to check the validity of the code. 
At first, a few errors were detected. In particular, in HTML the error concerned attribute target on element i that wasn't allowed. 
This error was fixed by deleting that attribute. 
In JavaScript there were a few semicolons missing or unnecessary, whih was corrected.

There are two known issues with this game, that couldn't be resolved. First issue seems to be connected to recursive popUp function 
and setTimeout inside it. The bug is represented by the one additional call of this function when it's supposed to have ended. In the game it
is represented by showing a veg when the countdown timer before the next level has started.
Another issue is related to the game music. In order to prevent the music from playing on each page, there was an attempt to 
save the state of the music toggle button in local storage. It worked, however the toggle button seems to be working only from the second click.

### Client Stories Testing
Most common path through the website: Home -> (Rules) -> Game -> Recipe.
On the Home and Game pages there's a play button right in the center. To visit rules, the player might want to
click on info icon.

### Testing client stories from UX section in README.md
As a first time player, I want to understand the rules of the game or to be able to find them:
* info icon on the home screen will lead to the Rules page.

As a first time player, I want to be able to navigate the game easily:
* play buttons are displayed in the center of the screen. All icons are easy to understand.

As a first time player, I want to be able to turn the music off if necessary:
* there's a button with widely recognized volume icon that toggles game music. The icon also changes when toggled.

As a return player, I want to see my previous score:
* the highest score is stored in local memory and is displayed during the game.

As a return player, I want to be able to increase the complexity of the game:
* this feature was left for future development.

### Testing on Different Browsers and Devices
The website was tested on different browsers and proved to be issue-free on the following browsers:
* Chrome;
* Safari.

While testing on Edge there was found an issue regarding local storage, meaning that the highest score wasn't saved or displayed.
However, when using local server this isuue is resolved.

The website was also tested on an IOS (Iphone 10) and Android (Pixel 4) platforms. At first the game wasn't displaying properly 
on IOS, but this issue was fixed by reorganizing the classes in the Game.html and proper implementation of Bootstrap.
There are some minor styling issues that can be seen on different screens, but they don't influence the overall feel and performance of the game.


### Testing on Potential Website Visitors
The game was tested on potential users - kids and adults. It was very appreciated by the kids. Adults spotted a bug, in particular 
a veg that appeared once in between changing rounds. This bug remains and need to be fixed during future development. 
Also this game looks quite simple for grownups, that's why defferent difficulty levels should be implemented in the future.
